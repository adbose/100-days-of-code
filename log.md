# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Researched for project ideas and topics to learn. Made initial changes to the repo, and raised a small PR on the original repository.

**Thoughts:** Coming up with an action plan for the 100 days of the challenge is pretty difficult. Have been thinking about project ideas mostly.

### Day 1: August 25

**Today's Progress**: Started developing a simple quotes generator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Built the basic layout and functionality.

**Thoughts** Implemented only a basic local version. More work is needed to make it fetch data from an API, share quotes via tweet, or even host the site online.
