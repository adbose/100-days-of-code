# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Researched for project ideas and topics to learn. Made initial changes to the repo, and raised a small PR on the original repository. 

**Thoughts:** Coming up with an action plan for the 100 days of the challenge is pretty difficult. Have been thinking about project ideas mostly.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
